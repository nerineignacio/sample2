		<h3><strong>By:</strong><em>Little Mix</em></h3><br />
		<p>
		I am the diamond you left in the dust<br />
		I am the future you lost in the past<br />
		Seems like I never compared<br />
		Wouldn't notice if I disappeared<br />
		You stole the love that I saved for myself<br />
		And I watched you give it to somebody else<br />
		But these scars no longer I hide<br />
		I found the light you shut inside <br />
		Couldn't love me if you tried<br />
		</p>
		<p>
		Am I still not good enough?<br />
		Am I still not worth that much?<br />
		I'm sorry for the way my life turned out<br />
		Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now <br />
		Guess I'm still not good enough<br /> 
		</p>
		<p>
		Does it burn<br />
		Knowing I used all the pain?<br />
		Does it hurt<br />
		Knowing you're fuel to my flame?<br />
		Don't look back<br />
		Don't need your regrets<br />
		THANK God you left my love behind<br /> 
		Couldn't change me if you tried<br /> 
		</p>
		<p>
		Am I still not good enough?<br />
		Am I still not worth that much?<br />
		I'm sorry for the way my life turned out<br />
		Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now<br />
		Guess I'm still not good enough<br /> 
		</p>
		<p>
		Release your curse <br />
		'Cause I know my worth <br />
		Those wounds you made are gone<br /> 
		You ain't seen nothing yet<br />
		Your love wore thin <br />
		And I never win<br />
		You want the best <br />
		So sorry that's clearly not me<br /> 
		This all I can be <br />
		</p>
		<p>
		Am I still not good enough?<br />
		Am I still not worth that much?<br />
		I'm sorry for the way my life turned out<br />
		Sorry for the smile I'm wearing now<br />
		Guess I'm still not good enough<br /> 
		</p>
